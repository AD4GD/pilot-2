    "This block is dedicated to refining initial land-use/land-cover (LULC) data with additional data on protected areas (PA) from [the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA)](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa).\n",
    "As soon as protected areas may significantly increase the suitability of landscapes and reduce landscape \"impedance\" for species migration, landscapes intersected with PAs should be considered as different from those with no protected status. This workflow describes the process of updating LULC data needed to compute functional landscape connectivity. It provides two main outputs:\n",
    "- LULC data enriched with protected areas (recorded as updated LULC value) for wide usage.\n",
    "- For habitat connectivity calculations, impedance and affinity values for calculations in specific  software (Miramon and Graphab).\n",
    "\n",
    "Current limitations:\n",
    "- WDPA API is accessed through personal credentials, while granting access to the API is not automatic and reviewed by the Protected Planet team.\n",
    "- WDPA API does not support getting data by bounding box, only by unique IDs of protected areas and countries.\n",
    "- Temporary server outage has been experienced with WDPA API (returning 'status code 500').\n",
    "- If a protected area is deestablished ('degazetted'), it is removed from the database and its ID cannot be reused (for further details, see the [manual on WDPA API](https://wdpa.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/WDPA_Manual/English/WDPA_WDOECM_Manual_1_6.pdf)). If it is the case, all historical transformations of these protected areas will be not accessible to request.\n",
    "- [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) is used as an ancillary tool to perform reverse geocoding and find countries intersecting with the input raster dataset to query for data through WDPA API. At the same time, boundaries of countries include the exclusive economic zones in seas and can cover not only terrestrial protected areas.\n",
    "- [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) does not fetch countries if bounding box of input raster dataset is within the spatial feature (country), but does not intersect with her borderline."
