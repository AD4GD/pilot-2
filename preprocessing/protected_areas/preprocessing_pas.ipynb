    "## Enriching LULC with data on protected areas\n",
    "\n",
    "This block of preprocessing code is dedicated to refining initial land-use/land-cover (LULC) data with additional data on protected areas (PA) from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA): https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa\n",
    "As soon as protected areas may significantly reduce the reflectance of landscapes for species migration, landscapes intersected with PAs should be considered as different from those with no protected status. This workflow is describing the process of updating LULC data needed to compute functional landscape connectivity. Impedance and affinity values derived from LULC data and required by Miramon and Graphab are also recomputed."
