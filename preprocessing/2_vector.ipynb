    "## Access and harmonisation of historical vector data on land-use/land-cover (LULC) - Open Street Map (OSM) data \n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is aimed at semi-automatic extraction and harmonisation of open-access Open Street Map (OSM) data at various timestamps relevant for researches dealing with land-use/land cover data. Overpass Turbo API applied to fetch specific types of OSM features, including human-built infrastructure (roads and railways) and mostly natural features (inland waters - waterways and water bodies). No user authentication is required to access Overpass Turbo API, but it is advised to extract data in a reasonable manner at spatial scales such as Catalonia, Spain or Nothern England (69 925 km<sup>2</sup> and 20 650 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively) to avoid issues related to API throttling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "Limitations relevant to the further processing of habitat connectivity are multiple, but mostly caused by logical inconsistency and incompleteness of features (omissions) rather than geometrical and topological inconsistency, especially at older timestamps. The common problem of defining keys and values for filtering data is caused by the lack of relevant information for older timestamps (comprehensive OSM quides and manuals are mostly focused on current rules of assigning tags).\n",
    "- Due to the active development of Open Street Map and increase in popularity since the launch, earlier timestamps from 2010s might lack a significant number of features compared to the current timestamp. For example, the total length of rivers and canals in Catalonia has increased by 27.3% from the end of the 2013 to 2022, while there were no significant nature- or human-driven changes in the water network. Such a change can be partly explained by the increase in the geometric data accuracy, smoothing and curving linear features, mapping linear features within water bodies, but it is also related to the increase in OSM popularity and adding other water features by new users.\n",
    "- Some roads are missing key \"surface\". Therefore, paving of roads is not considered even though some narrow, unpaved and non-frequent roads might be crossed regularly by species.\n",
    "- Some keys are not consistent throughout years (for example, level of roads is missing in data from 2012 and 2013 years).\n",
    "- Presence of invalid numerical values (for example, width of roads = \"3000\" or \"6 m\" which requires additional preprocessing). Unique values by keys can be explored in detail here through [taginfo tool](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org.uk/keys/width#values).\n",
    "- Logical inconsistency in defining tags for types of roads throughout the years (can be defined as *'primary'*, and redefined as a *'secondary'* one later).\n",
    "- Logical inconsistency in defining keys for water reservoirs (can be defined as *'land_use'* types instead of *'water'* types) at older timestamps (2012-2013).\n",
    "- Changes in geometry types of water features - some rivers have been mapped as ways at older timestamps, but have been complemented with multipolygon features later. Was experienced in Catalonia (2012, 2013, 2017 timestamps).\n",
    "- According to checks on the validity of vector data during the testing, waterbodies derived from Open Street Map might have invalid geometry, which might insignificantly complicate the further processing (0.01-0.04% from the total number of features, depending on the bounding box and timestamp).\n",
    "- During the peak load on Overpass servers, bulky queries might be refused with error: *\"Remote connection closed unexpectedly\"* (faced with queries on roads). Quite high limit rates on memory consumption and query time are defined in this workflow by default but it is advised to fetch data from OSM at local or regional scale to prevent throttling issues.\n",
    "- Queries on historical data with specified timestamp tend to be more time-consuming than the same ones without timestamps."

    "There are two main options of output data formats - json and csv. Json is more bulky to transform to other spatial data formats and less flexible than csv, but another common library helps to quickly transform OSM jsons to geojsons easily - [osmtogeojson](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo/GeoJSON). There are also other export options in the [official documentation](https://dev.overpass-api.de/output_formats.html): OSM XML, HTMPL popups and custom formats. However, these solutions are not stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "UPD: CSV is fetched more quickly and it is suitable with larger sizes of data fetched (including multiple 'tertiary' roads), but coordinates from assigned nodes are glitched (order of nodes is mixed up). It might be possible to fix these issues related to the order of coordinates, but this workflow is not aimed at the optimisation of convertation since the stable solution of transforming json exists. Therefore, JSON has been chosen over CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use OSM JSON response further in preprocessing, [osmtogeojson](https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojsonlibrary) is used (NPM is pre-installed within the docker container to get an access to osmtogeojson). At this step, non-suitable geometries (points and polygons for roads, railways and waterways) are filtered out. "
