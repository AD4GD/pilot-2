### Enrichment of land-use/land-cover (LULC) data
The preprocessing workflow currently includes three separate Jupyter Notebooks:

- **[Enrichment with data on protected areas](1_protected_areas/1_preprocessing_pas.ipynb)**
Available only through the authorised credentials (token), as it uses the special API (should be an optional module).
- **[Fetching historical vector data](2_osm_historical.ipynb)**
Available without authorised credentials, uses open-access API (mandatory).
- **[Rewriting and harmonising input data](3_preprocessing.ipynb)**
Preprocessing itself â€“ reprojection, checking, rewriting raster files etc. (mandatory)

Detailed descriptions of each nested workflow are given at the beginnings of Jupyter Notebooks.

The workflow can be also explored on the overarching diagram:![diagram](visualisation/workflow.png)

#### Current state

This tool is mostly completed, but a few improvements are planned to be done:

- **Design user-friendly GUI tool (maybe, semi-automatic) instead of separate Notebooks/scripts and prepare for the publication.**
- **Implement Common Workflow Language (CWL).**
- **Protected Planet API: iterate over the pages of the response and concatenate to the final response.**
- Implement iterations over multiple LULC files (by year and location) and multiple OSM requests (iterating over the combination of filename-yearname).
- Test [ohsome API](https://docs.ohsome.org/ohsome-api/v1/) again to prove that not all attributes of OSM features can be fetched and justify the usage of Overpass Turbo API instead of ohsome API. See [issue](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-api/issues/332).
- Complete statistics for deprecated and new tags for Catalonia and UK through ohsome API.
- Create a few options of 'decay rate' (from specific categories of land use, 'stressors') expressions for user to choose from.
- Replace NULL values of 'width' for roads and railways with self-defined width in SQL queries.
- Implement [VRT](https://gdal.org/en/latest/drivers/raster/vrt.html) file format if possible to save resource.
- WDPA API. For LULC codes covered by protected areas, define the multiplier of impedance (effect of protected areas), cast to the yaml file and automatically estimate impedance value.
- For use case study: revisit Catalonian government data and decide on its usage.
