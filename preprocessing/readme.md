## **Data4Land** tool - enriching land-use/land-cover with historical vector(s) data (v.2.0.0)

Data4Land tool is developed to enrich various land-use/land-cover (LULC) spatial data with data from another sources to increase the consistency and reliability of LULC datasets for multiple purposes. This software currently includes four independent components which can be run in command-line interface (CLI):

1. **[Access to historical data from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and data harmonization](src/protected_areas/)**
Available only through the authorised credentials (token), as it uses the special API. Jupyter Notebook format with detailed documentation is available [here](src/1_pas.ipynb).
2. **[Access and harmonisation of historical LULC data in vector - Open Street Map (OSM) data ](src/osm/)**
Freely available without authorised credentials, uses open-access API. Jupyter Notebook is available [here](src/2_vector.ipynb).
3. **[Enrichment of LULC data](src/enrichment/)**
Enhancing of initial LULC data with supplementary data from 1st and 2nd blocks, or user-defined data. Jupyter Notebook is available [here](src/3_enrichment.ipynb).
4. **[Impedance calculation ('edge effect' of biodiversity stressors)](src/impedance/)**
Calculates 'landscape impedance' datasets based on user-defined biodiversity stressors. This component is useful for researchers to conduct follow-up studies on nature conservation and habitat connectivity. Jupyter Notebook is available [here](src/4_impedance.ipynb).

Detailed documentation on each nested component is given at the beginnings of corresponding Jupyter Notebooks and includes descriptions of all input and output datasets valid for v 1.0.0.

Sample input datasets are different for v1.0.0 and v2.0.0.  
**v1.0.0**: Sample dataset is from [ESA Sentinel-2 World Cover](https://collections.sentinel-hub.com/impact-observatory-lulc-map/) remote sensing collections, covering a part of Northern England.  
**v2.0.0**:  
- From the [land-use/land-cover map of Catalonia (MCSC)](https://www.opengis.grumets.cat/MCSC) with 7 LULC types, covering the whole of Catalonia, located [here](src/data/cat_aggr_buf_30m).
- The subdataset of MCSC Catalonia, covering only the small north-eastern part, but including 24 LULC types, located [here](src/data/case_study_albera).
As input LULC datasets can be potentially used across multiple sub case studies, they are located in the [shared](src/data/shared).
Therefore, Data4Land provides scalable solution to enrich LULC datasets with different spatial extent and level of granularity.

All configuration to execute the components of Data4Land tool is pre-defined for the sample dataset in the [configuration YAML file](src/config/config.yaml): paths, filenames, API parameters, and user-defined numerical parameters.
The v.2.0.0 supports **case studies** and **sub case studies**. For example, user would like to run Data4Land tool for completely different LULC datasets, covering Catalonia and England. In this case, user must specify `case_study_dir` in the [configuration file](src/config/config.yaml), for example, `case_study_dir: 'catalonia'`, as Catalonia and England have completely independent LULC datasets.

Also, there might be the same LULC datasets for one case study area, for example, covering Catalonia in 2012-2022, but user would like to execute them with different landscape impedance (or resistance) parameter. In this case they must provide the series of landscape impedance datasets for each **sub case study** and define it in the configuration file, for example, `subcase_study: 'forest'` or `subcase_study: 'meadows'` to calculate outputs for different LULC types. User is free to define sub case studies for other objects, aside from LULC types, for example, for species: `subcase_study: 'turtle'`. However, it is crucial to provide the relevant landscape impedance datasets for each sub case study, putting them to the following path: `src/data/**case_study**/input/**subcase_study**_impedance/`. See the example of configured path [here](src/data/cat_aggr_buf_30m/input/forest_impedance/).

Data flow within the Data4Land tool can be also explored on the overarching diagram:![diagram](visualisation/workflow.png).

### Usage and command references

The Data4Land tool should be run within the container environment. To create the container, run:
`docker-compose up`
It will build the container with the necessary requirements.

Inside the created container environment, use the following prompt structure:
`main.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...`

To see the available commands, type `python main.py --help`.

### Examples

To test if your instance of Data4Land is configured correctly, execute the test command:
```bash
python main.py user_name user_surname --formal
```
It will render: 
`Hello Mr. user_name user_surname`

To execute the **1st component**, run:
```bash
python main.py process-wdpa --config-dir ./config --force --verbose
```
We do not recommend to change the name and path to the configuration file. Verbose mode will show the whole log of operations behind the command-line tool, and it is recommended to enable it if troubleshooting required.

`--force` mode for this command will automatically say 'yes' to the following promt after printing the codes of countries intersecting the bounding box of input raster:
`Type 'yes' or 'y' to confirm API fetch for the above countries?"`

**2nd component**:
```bash
python main.py process-osm --config-dir ./config --verbose --del-temp
```
It is usually recommended to enable --del-temp if you are working with multiple LULC rasters in Data4Land tool. Otherwise, rewriting conflicts and adding new features to previous GeoJSON and GeoPackage files are possible.

`--force` mode for this command will automatically say 'all' to the following prompt after printing the years configured to fetch OSM data:
`Type 'all' or enter the year to fetch OSM data from the following years: "`

In v.2.0.0, user can specify whether they would like to use [Overpass Turbo](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_turbo) or [ohsome API](https://docs.ohsome.org/ohsome-api/v1/) to fetch OSM data. Ohsome API is recommended, as it is more stable and provides quicker fetching, especially for multiple timestamps and large spatial extents.

**3d**:
```bash
python main.py enrich-lulc --config-dir ./config --verbose --save-osm-stressors
```
This component enriches the input land-use/land-cover (LULC) dataset with the fetched OSM data.
If user would like to execute the 4th component later on, they should enable `--save-osm-stressors` to use these intermediate GeoTIFF outputs (biodiversity stressors) in the recalculation of landscape impedance. However, the enabled parameter will require additional time to process the stressors.

**4th**:
```bash
python main.py recalc-impedance --config-dir ./config --verbose
```
If users enable `--del-stressors` intermediate GeoTIFF files will be deleted. If you would like to explore these files to check the consistency of computation or debug the process, you should disable `--del-stressors`.

While executing this command, you will see the warning asking you to check and update the configuration on the biodiversity stressors. By default, Data4Land creates the sample parameters for each stressors, but in reality users will highly likely put other values depending on their expertise, empirical knowledge of ecological parameters, or bibliography. For example, roads and railways could be considered to have exponential character of decline, but have different values of decline parameter.

The custom configuration of parameters used for the sample data in Catalonia and Northern England [here](src/config/config_examples).

### **Common problems and solutions**

##### **`process-wdpa`**
- When trying to fetch the borders of countries intersecting with the input raster dataset, the following error pops up:
> Error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.ohsome.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/elements/geometry (Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, '[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1000)')))
**Solution**: run the command again with the same parameters.

##### **`process-osm`**
- The first execution of this command might face with the following error:
> Error: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.ohsome.org', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/elements/geometry (Caused by SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, '[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1000)')))
**Solution**: run the command again with the same parameters.

##### **`enrich-lulc`**
- The `enrich-lulc` command might occasionally fail if you check out the intermediate outputs in the external software, such as QGIS, with the following message:
> Error: sqlite3_prepare_v2(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sqlite_master WHERE name IN ('gpkg_metadata', 'gpkg_metadata_reference') AND type IN ('table', 'view')) failed:
attempt to write a readonly database
May be caused by: attempt to write a readonly database
**Solution**: delete intermediate outputs, such as buffered features, for example `roads_2012_buffered.gpkg` from the `/src/data/case_study/input/vector` directory.
- The `enrich-lulc` command might fail after reprojecting the OpenStreetMap dataset with the error:
Error: /src/data/cat_aggr_buf_30m/input/vector/osm_merged_2012.gpkg_transformed.gpkg: No such file or directory
**Solution**: run the command again with the same parameters.
- **Warning**: if you delete stressors, you would have to calculate them again using the 3d command to proceed with the 4th command.

Not each issue is known so far, so if you have faced something different, please let us know by opening a new issue.

#### Further development
This tool is mostly complete, but a few improvements could be made if there is demand from users.

- Extend the implementation of [VRT](https://gdal.org/en/latest/drivers/raster/vrt.html) file format to save resource (currently implemented only for OSM features defined with sub-types - roads, such as primary, secondary, tertiary etc.).
- Implement ingestion of other spatial features in raster format which may act opposed to biodiversity stressors, for example, [small woody features](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/high-resolution-layer-small-woody-features.)
- Implement AI agent for on-fly construction of queries to OSM database from the user input and follow-up enrichment of LULC datasets (supposedly through Natural Language Processing model).
- Implement custom data on protected areas in case if user doesn't have a token for Protected Planet API. This will help to bypass the limitations of the API and will help to use other data on protected areas, for example, small urban protected areas with relatively mild restrictions, not recorded in the World Database on Protected Areas. As soon as the first component is currently fetching data in geojson format, the translation to geopackage is required in code (gpkg,shp,csv are available on WDPA for manual download without athentification).

#### Impact
The example of follow-up calculations of habitat connectivity based on non-enriched and enriched LULC datasets is given [here](stats/) to illustrate the significant impact of enriched raster pixels even if a small share of pixels is modified by vector data.
